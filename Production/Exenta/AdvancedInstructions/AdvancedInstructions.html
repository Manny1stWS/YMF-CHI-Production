					SHORTCUTS AND NAVIGATION VIEWS:
				</h2>
				<p>
					You can setup shortcuts by clicking the Search Icon on the top left side of Exenta:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Shortcut01.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Then in the “Search Application” you can type what you want to set up as a shortcut.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Shortcut02.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					For Example, you can type “Style Master” then click and drag Style Master from the left side to the right side. After you do this whenever you click the Search Icon on top left, you will have a Tile with Style Master that you can click on for easy access.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Shortcut03.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Clicking the Search Icon on the top left size of Exenta also gives you access to customize the way Exenta looks and/or displays your shortcuts.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Shortcut04.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Section A displays the last 5 tables you have accessed in Exenta.
				</p>
				<p>
					Section B “My Favorites Launcher” allows you to always have access to all your shortcuts on the left side of the screen.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Shortcut05.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Section C “My Settings” allows you to change theme colors used in the application and you can change the “MenuOption” from “Traditional” which is the standard view which has the navigation on top:
				</P>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Shortcut06.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Or “MenuOption” “Outlook” which will have the navigation on bottom left and all your favorites shortcuts on top left:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Shortcut07.png">
				</center>
				<h2 id="search">
					SEARCH FUNCTIONS AND DISPLAYED COLUMNS:
				</h2>
				<p>
					If you want to search for multiple Styles in the Style Master, you can easily copy them from an excel file and paste them in Exenta and Exenta will separate each style with a comma as long as each style is in a separate cell. For example:
				</p>
				<p>
					Click the “Find Mode” icon <img class="smallpic" src="images/FindMode.png">:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Search01.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Copy the styles you want to search from your excel file:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="smallpic2" src="images/Search02.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Paste them in the Style field and then click the “Apply Filter” icon <img class="smallpic" src="images/ApplyFilter.png">:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Search03.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					The Styles you are searching for will display in the “Result” tab of the Style Master:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Search04.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					You can easily see the number of styles that are being displayed by Maximizing the Style Master Window and looking at the bottom right side of the App:
				</p>
				<p>
					In this example I searched for 3 Styles:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="smallpic2" src="images/Search05.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					If you are searching for over 30 Styles, “Paging” will appear in the top section next to the X:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Search06.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					In this example I searched for 36 Styles, but the bottom right side of the App is showing 1 of 30:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="smallpic2" src="images/Search07.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					This is because the system is default to display 30 searched rows at a time. You can display everything you searched for by clicking Paging and Show All:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Search08.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					After doing this the bottom right side will show all styles you searched for:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="smallpic2" src="images/Search09.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					The columns displayed in the “Result” tab of your Exenta App, might not be the same as the ones I showed previously. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In order for you to show specific columns, you will need to right click on one of the columns then click columns and Show/Hide Columns:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Display01.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					Then you can move the “Hidden Columns” on the left to the “Displayed Columns” on the right by selecting what you want to move than then clicking > or < or moving the displayed columns up or down. Be careful not to click the >> or << because these buttons will move everything.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Display02.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					These are the columns that you should display for the Style Master Search Result:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Display03.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					After having the columns that you want to display in the “Displayed Columns” right side, click OK.
				</p>
				<p class="red">
					It is very important that you right click on one of the columns again and click “Save my layout”. If you do not do this, after you close the Exenta App and open it again whatever changes you made will revert to what you had before saving your layout.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Display04.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					In the Style Master “Data” tab and “Style Detail” section, these are the columns that you should display:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Display05.png">
				</center>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Display06.png">
				</center>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Display07.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					In Production Order Maintenance and “Prod Order Detail”, these are the columns that you should display:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Display08.png">
				</center>
				<center>
					<img class="small" src="images/Display09.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					These are some of the definitions of the displayed columns in “Prod Order Detail” that might not be self-explanatory:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Stage:  We are currently using 3 Stages:
					</li>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>
								Proform: this is the initial stage showing open balances.
							</li>
							<li>
								Boat: these are shown after containers packing lists have been uploaded.
							</li>
							<li>
								Rec: these are shown after containers have been received.
							</li>
						</ol>
					<li>
						Prod Line Qty: This shows the original quantity ordered.
					</li>
					<li>
						Moved Qty: This shows the quantities that have been moved between stages.
					</li>
					<li>
						Moved Qty: This shows the quantities that have been moved between stages.
					</li>
				</ol>

					INVENTORY REPORT:
				</h2>
				<p>
					You can check inventory by going to Inquiries > Item Management Inquiry:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Inventory01.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					In here you can search by any of the fields displayed and then clicking search:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Inventory02.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					If you want to search multiple styles, you can list the styles you want to search for and separate them with a comma.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then the system will display all the styles in all the different Whs Groups or different Variations of Label, PPK and/or Size Codes if there were multiple variations setup in one Style:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/Inventory03.png">
				</center>
				<p>
					These are some of the definitions of the displayed columns that might not be self-explanatory:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							QOH: These are the quantities currently on hand before customers’ orders are shipped.
						</li>
						<li>
							Open Qty: These are the quantities customers have ordered for this style but have not yet been picked by the system.
						</li>
						<li>
							Alloc Qty: The quantities that have been allocated from the Open Qty and what’s available from QOH after Pick Qty. Note that the Alloc Qty is still part of the Open Qty.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pick Qty: These are the quantities that have been picked by the system.
						</li>
						<li>
							Avail QOH: These are the quantities available after Open Qty and Pick Qty.
						</li>
						<li>

						</li>

						</li>
						<li>
