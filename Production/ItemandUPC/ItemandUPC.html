					How to Create Style Numbers:
				</h2>
				<p>
					In the Production Server go to “Style & UPC” Folder located in: Z:\Production\Style & UPC 09-30-22.
				</p>
				<p>
					Open the “Style # 2011” excel file. Do not make changes to the file if you open it as Read-Only because someone else has the file opened and is creating Styles. Send a message through the Production Team Chat to close the file if they don’t need it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Style numbers are set up by the customer and normally begin with a 2-letter prefix made up from the customer’s name and another letter representing the category of the Style.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each customer will have its own tab where style numbers can be created for the corresponding customer if the styles you are creating will not use Royalty Brands Packaging. All Styles that will use Royalty Brands Packaging must be entered in the YMF tab.
				</p>
				<p>
					In column “A” you will enter the customer’s prefix plus the category letter. For example, if the customer is Dollar General and the Style’s category is Accent Rug, you will enter DGA.
				</p>

					</ol>
				<p>
					Do not use "O" for other if the category of the Style you are creating is not listed here. Ask management to assign a letter to the category you are working on.
				</p>
				<p>
					In column "B" there will be a 6-digit code setup from 000001 to 001000 to start. If necessary the number can be increased up to 999999.
				</p>
				<p>
					In column "C" there is a formula that combines column A & B once you enter a description in column "D".
				</p>
				<p id="descriptions">
					Descriptions in column "D" must be made in the following order:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							For the 1st part of the description, use one of these or a combination these: Brand Name, Style's Category, Collection Name, Product Unique Characteristic, and Design's Name:
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									Brand Name - normally used in the packaging.
								</li>
								<li>
									Style's Category - Always use this as the first word specially if you are bringing assortments of multiple designs.
								</li>
								<li>
									Collection Name - this is normally dictated by the person who gave you the order.
								</li>
								<li>
									Design' Name - Only use this as the first word in the description if you are ordering a design that has multiple sizes in multiple colors.
								</li>
							</ol>
						<li>
							For the 2nd part of the description, use the size(s):
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									When an Style has multiple sizes to make a set, write the biggest size followed by the number of sizes in the set. For example, if you are ordering a 20x30, 20x20 and 20x19 as a set, you will write "20x30 3pc Set". If you are ordering 2pc Sets, write the 2 sizes. For example, "18x30/17x24 2pc Set".
								</li>
							</ol>
						<li>
							For the 3rd part of the description, use the design's name:
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									If the design's name is not used in the first part of the description, use it on the 3rd part.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the Style you created has multiple designs, you can write "Assorted".
								</li>
							</ol>
						<li>
							For the 4th part of the description, write the main color of the Style.:
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									If the Style (single sku) has multiple colors but there is a color that is predominant, write that color.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the Style (single sku) has multiple colors but it is difficult to tell which color is predominant, write "Multi".
								</li>
								<li>
									If the Style (single sku) only has 2 colors, write the 2 colors.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the Style (multiple skus) with multiple colors, write "Assorted".
								</li>
							</ol>
					</ol>
				<p>
					Please note that in Exenta there are 2 style description limits:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The long form description “Style Desc” has a 100 characters limit.
						</li>
						<li>
							The short form description “Style Name” has 30 characters limit. If you need to reduce the number of characters, start by abbreviating the word “Assorted” if used. Or reduce the number of sizes listed if the Style is a set; For example, only write “2pc Set”. If this is not enough, abbreviate color’s name.
						</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					These are other rules you should follow for the descriptions to keep things clean and consistent in Exenta:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Do not write the description with all capital letters.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not write the description with all small letters.
						</li>
						<li>
							Write the first letter of every word in the description capitalized.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make sure there is only one space between words.
						</li>
						<li>
							When you paste descriptions into Navision, remove any special characters that come up.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make sure the description does not start with extra spaces.
						</li>
						<li>
							Keep in mind that the sales department want to be able to sort the Styles by description to see a group of Styles of the same kind together.
						</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					Write your name's initials next to the description and make sure you save the excel file before closing it.

					If you have a new customer which is not listed in any of tabs, ask management to add it.

					How to assign UPCs to Style Numbers:
				</h2>
				<p>
					In the Production Server go to “Style & UPC” Folder located in: Z:\Production\Style & UPC 09-30-22
				</p>
				<p>
					Open the “UPC Check Digit 2021-06-24” excel file. Do not make changes to the file if you open it as Read-Only because someone else has the file opened and is assigning UPCs. Send a message through the Production Team Chat to close the file if they don’t need it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note that not all Style#s need UPC. Only assign UPCs to the Style#s that need them. Customers like Ross and Burlington require pre-ticketing with the customer's UPCs. Do not assign UPCs to these types of Styles.
				</p>
				<p
					>Make sure there are no filters set in the excel file. If you see the symbol below on any of the top headings in the excel file, it means there is a filter.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/filter1.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					You can remove all the filters in the excel by going to Data on the top section of the excel and clicking Clear:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/filter2.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					If you leave the filter and paste a group of Styles and descriptions, you might be pasting over other Style#s and descriptions already in the file. Make sure you do not paste over Style#s and description already in the file.
				</p>
				<p>
					The UPC Check Digit will have a list of all the UPCs assigned or unassigned in column "X". Assigned UPCs will have Style#s, Description, Issued by and Prepack in columns Y, Z, AA and AB.
				</p>
				<p>
					Find a UPC that does not have an Style# and Description in columns Y and Z.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/stylenumbers2.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					Copy the Style# and description (Columns C and D) you created in Style & UPC and do a paste values using this symbol <img class="small" src="images/pastevalue.jpg"> after right clicking the cell you will paste. Enter your initials in columns AA and the case pack in column AB:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="large" src="images/stylenumbers3.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					Make sure you save before closing the file.
