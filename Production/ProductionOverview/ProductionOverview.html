				<h2 id="ordersdistro">
					ORDERS DISTRIBUTION AND INFORMATION
				</h2>
					<p>
						Orders are received in various ways:
					</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								You might get an email from the customer with information about what items and quantities the customer wants to order written on the email. 
							</li>
							<li>
								You might get an excel with items and quantities the customer wants.
							</li>
							<li>
								You might get a PDF Customer PO by email.
							</li>
							<li>
								You might be asked to access a customer’s website to download an order from the customer.
							</li>
						</ol>
					<p>
						If you are not asked directly by Leadership to place an order, make sure to check with them to make sure it is OK to place the order.
					</p>
					<p>
						Regardless of how you get a customer’s order, it is important you know if that order will be received via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) directly into our system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Customers like TJX, Costco, Burlington, Big Lots, Family Dollar, and Old Time Pottery normally send their orders via EDI directly to Exenta.
					</p>
					<p>
						When orders are received via EDI it is crucial to provide customers with the corresponding Style#s for the items the customer wants to order. These Style#s must be entered into Exenta within 5 business days to ensure seamless processing and prevent system-related issues. Failure to input the Style#s before EDI reception may result in notifications from the EDI team.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon receiving an order from a customer, salesman, or manager, the critical step is to promptly place the order on the same day with the essential information. This allows for the generation of a proforma invoice from the vendor, providing pricing details and a commitment to deliver the goods by the specified date. Timely action ensures efficient processing and facilitates necessary arrangements with the vendor.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you do not get the essential information needed, please communicate with Leadership about the missing information.

									Getting Proforma Invoices from vendors:
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									You should try to get the proforma invoice in no more than 3 business days after emailing your PO to a vendor. If it takes you longer, you must inform the manager that gave you the order.
								</li>
								<li>
									The proforma invoice must have a list of the Style#s & Descriptions you are ordering, and including the materials and quality of the items, price per square or (price per piece only when price per square meter is not applicable), total amount, ETD, origin and destination ports, cubic meter of each item, total cubic meter, vendor’s name, and vendor’s bank information. We prefer that vendors follow our standard proforma invoice. (See <a href="../FileLocations/FileLocations.html">File Locations Page</a>).
								</li>
								<li>
									The PI must have payment terms of 100% against documents or 100%TT but there are times when vendors require deposit and depending on the vendor, we will accept no more than 10% deposit and 90% against documents. Pay close attention to payment terms in PI and point it out to the manager signing the PI if a deposit is required.
								</li>
							</ol>
						<li>
							<h3 id="signproforma">
								<em>
									Getting Proforma Invoice signed to send back to vendor:
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									After checking the proforma invoice has the info listed previously and checking total amount matches, you must get the PI signed by Yaron or Jonathan the same day you get the PI. If Jonathan or Yaron do not give you time to sign the PI’s after 3 business days of attempting to get them to sign your PI, talk to your production manager about it.
								</li>
								<li>
									You can print the PI and have Yaron or Jonathan signed your PI, or you can submit the PI using this website: <a href="https://smallpdf.com" target="_blank">https://smallpdf.com</a>. Ask the production manager for username and password.
								</li>
								<li>
									Vendors will not honor the proforma invoice if the PI is signed too long after receiving it.
								</li>
								<li>
									For Yaron or Jonathan to sign PIs, sometimes they will ask to show them a margin sheet. Talk to the production manager about how to create a margin sheet.
								</li>
								<li>
									The production manager can sign PI’s but only if Yaron or Jonathan had signed a previous PI with the same price and quality.
								</li>
								<li>
									Make sure you point out the payment terms if the vendor is requesting a deposit.
								</li>
							</ol>
						<li>
							<h3 id="emailproforma">
								<em>
									Emailing signed Proforma Invoice back to vendor:
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									You must scan and save the signed PI in the proforma invoice folder in the production file server. This will allow the import department to easily find it to process payment to vendors once goods are shipped. (See <a href="../FileLocations/FileLocations.html">File Locations Page</a>).
								</li>
								<li>
									Check the scanned PI, if the document is not clear, save the original PI that you received in the proforma invoice folder in the production server.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the PI requires deposit, you must email the signed PI to <a href="mailto:APaccounting@ymfinc.com">APaccounting@ymfinc.com</a>, <a href="mailto:jpatel@ymfinc.com">jpatel@ymfinc.com</a> and <a href="mailto:ahalbe@ymfinc.com">ahalbe@ymfinc.com</a> and ask them to process the payment of the deposit. A lot of times PI will say shipping date is 50 days after receiving deposit. Vendors will not honor the ETD in the PI unless they receive the deposit with enough time.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the vendor is new (Vendor is not in Exenta), you must ask the vendor to fill out “VendorSet-upForm”. (See <a href="../FileLocations/FileLocations.html">File Locations Page</a>). Once you receive the form from the vendor, email it to Jay Patel <a href="mailto:jpatel@ymfinc.com">jpatel@ymfinc.com</a> along with the signed PI and ask him to setup this new vendor.

								<em>
									Getting the signed Proforma Invoice stamped by vendor:
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									This will solidify the agreement between us and vendor.
								</li>
								<li>
									A lot of times the first time you get the PI, it will already have the vendor's company stamp.
								</li>
								<li>
									Also save this file in the proforma invoice folder in the production file server.

							<h3 id="approvinglabdips">
								<em>
									Getting and approving lab dips and preproduction samples from vendors:
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									The very first time you order an item from a vendor; you must request lab dips to make sure colors will meet our standards.
								</li>
								<li>
									You should try to get Lab dips in no more than 1 week after the order is placed.
								</li>
								<li>
									Once you receive the lab dips, review them with the design team.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the design team does not approve the first lab dips and you get a 2nd round of lab dips and they do not approve the 2nd round, you must get leadership involved since asking for lab dips a 3rd time might get the order delayed.
								</li>
								<li>
									Preproduction samples are extremely important especially if it is the first time when we are buying a product from a vendor.
								</li>
								<li>
									You should try to get pp samples in no more than 2 weeks after lab dips are approved. Notify the leadership involved with the order if it takes longer. This usually means the order will be delayed.
								</li>
								<li>
									Once you get the pp sample, the first thing you need to do is measure and weight the product to check the grams per square meter (GSM) to check if matches the quality ordered. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Schedule a meeting with the designers involved in the development of the item and Jonathan or Yaron to get an approval.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the pp sample is not approved, always be aware about when the customer needs the goods and how asking for another pp sample would affect the order’s ETD. Get leadership involved if pp samples are not approved the 1st time you get them since asking for revised pp samples a 2nd time might delay your order.

							<h3 id="inspections">	
								<em>
									Getting and approving Inspection Reports:
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									You should try to get inspection reports at least 14 days before the agreed ETD. If you do not get an inspection report 14 days before the ETD, it is usually a sign the order will be late. Try to get info from the vendor about the order and let leadership know if the order is late. We have in house inspectors for orders shipping from China, India, and Turkey. Orders you place from other countries will require you to contact a 3rd party inspection company to schedule the inspection well in advance.
								</li>
								<li>
									Review and comment on inspection reports the same day you get them.
								</li>
								<li>
									In the inspection, you should see pictures of the boxes, the box labels, where the box labels are placed, measurement of the boxes, headers on the product, closeup of the UPC or price stickers on the header, measurements of the product, weight of the product, defects found. You should check all these things against the order you place and approve the inspection if everything matches the order.
								</li>
								<li>
									If you see any issues, you must inform the leadership to determine if a chargeback is required.
								</li>
								<li>
									Email vendor about the chargeback and have them confirm it.
								</li>
								<li>
									Make sure the import department is included in emails approving inspection report or discussion about chargebacks.

							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									Make sure vendors send you, our import department, and Account Payable shipping documents within 2 business days of the goods being loaded in containers.
								</li>
								<li>
									You will need to check the packing list to make sure it has the necessary information such as container#, loading date, sailing date, ETA, correct destination ports, correct warehouse code, correct po#, correct quantity, correct customer po#.
								</li>
								<li>
									You will need to check the commercial invoice matches the items and quantity of the packing list and the price matches the signed PI.
								</li>
								<li>
									Email the import department confirming that you checked the shipping documents, and everything looks good. Make sure this is done at least 2 weeks before ETA of containers.
								</li>
								<li>
									If we need to issue a chargeback because of issues, let the import department know of the chargeback.

								<em>
									Making sure orders are arriving to destination on time (specially customer orders):
								</em>
							</h3>
						</li>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									The ETA on the shipping documents is normally close to the actual date the container will arrive at the port.
								</li>
								<li>
									For POE orders, it is recommended the ETA is 2 or 3 business days before the customer’s ship date. 
								</li>
								<li>
									If the ETA on the packing list is within the customer ship window, the order should be considered on time.
								</li>
								<li>
									You should check the container status on the carrier's website 2 or 3 days after the sailing date to check the ETA has not changed. Take a screenshot of the ETA on the website in case we need to show proof the container was on time. Make sure the date is on the screenshot in case the ETA changes later.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the ETA changes and it is on or after the cancel date, you need to notify the leadership.
								</li>
								<li>
									You should track your containers at least once a week until the containers arrive.
								</li>
								<li>
									Check with the import department to make sure POE orders are routed on time. Normally customers ask for POE orders to be routed at least 7 days before ETA.
