					SHIPPING AND SCHEDULING
				</h2>
				<h3>
					STANDARD VENDOR CONDITIONS
				</h3>
				<p>
					All these rules apply to all shipments and must be followed with all the purchase orders that YMF Carpet Inc. places with your company.
				</p>
				<h3>
					General Requirements:
				</h3>
				<p>
					All vendors must provide YMF the outer pack dimension of the goods ordered within 7 business days after the order is placed so that YMF can determine if the order needs be increased or decreased to completely fill 40HQ containers.
				</p>
				<p>
					All vendors must provide a Proforma Invoice within 3 business days after receiving YMF's purchase order. The Proforma Invoice must have the following minimum information: Vendor's Name, Address, Tel#, Email, Contact Name, Date, Proforma invoice#, Loading Port, Destination Port, Shipping Date, YMF's PO#, YMF's Style#, Description of Style, Pieces of each Style, Case Pack of Each Style, Total Packs of each Style, Unit Price, Total Amount per Style#, Material, Size, Construction Specification, Total Grams per Square Meter of each Style, Price per Square Meter of each Style, Total CBM, Shipping terms, Payment Terms, Terms and Conditions from Purchase Order and Bank information. We prefer vendors use our standard Proforma Invoice which has all required fields.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Freight Terms:
				</h3>
				<p>
					YMF's standard freight terms for all shipments is FOB port. All exceptions must be in writing on YMF's PO and on Proforma Invoice.
				</p>
				<p>
					All freight costs from the vendor to the port are at the vendor's expense.
				</p>
				<p>
					YMF is responsible for Ocean Freight. Vendors must use YMF's preferred carriers when shipping from China.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vendor cannot schedule containers for YMF before providing Ocean Freight charges to YMF and getting an approval of the Ocean Freight in writing.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Delivery Windows
				</h3>
				<p>
					When we provide a port arrival window in our purchase orders, containers must arrive at the destination port within the given window.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the order will be late, YMF needs to be notified 30 days in advance. Penalties may still apply.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Scheduling Shipment of Containers
				</h3>
				<p>
					All purchase orders shipping from China are handled by our coordinator(s) in China.
				</p>
				<p>
					All purchase orders shipping from India are handled by our coordinator(s) in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					All purchase orders shipping from other countries are handled by our coordinator(s) in USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is the vendor's responsibility to notify by email our coordinator(s) in China, India or USA at least 3 weeks before the goods are ready so that the containers can be booked with enough time to allow you to ship on time.
				</p>
				<h3 id="loading">
					Loading Containers
				</h3>
				<p>
					YMF only accepts 40HQ containers. All exceptions must be in writing on YMF's PO and on Proforma Invoice.
				</p>
				<p>
					All containers must be floor loaded unless otherwise stated in the purchase order.
				</p>
				<p>
					When loading containers, vendors must load 1 complete Style# at a time. For example, if you have 3 Styles in a purchase order, you must load Style #1 completely, then load Style #2 completely, then Style#3 completely. Do not load Styles in different locations throughout the container. Any mixing of Styles in different locations of the container are subject to penalties that will be issued to your company.
				</p>
				<p>
					Packing Lists must reflect the order in which the Styles were loaded in the container.
				</p>
				<p>
					All containers must be completely full with at least 68 CBM. We understand that sometimes containers are completely full with less than 68CBM and so we ask all vendors to always submit pictures of the empty container, after loading 33% of the container, after loading 66% of the container and after loading 100% of the container. We must see two 100% pictures; 1st picture with both doors opened and 2nd picture with door that has the container# closed so we can see what container# is completely full.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a vendor miscalculates or loads a container inefficiently where part of the order cannot be loaded in the planned container(s), YMF will not give a penalty to the vendor if it is the first time the vendor is shipping an Style to YMF if the shortage it's less than 10% of the order.
				</p>
				<p>
					YMF should be offered the leftover goods first before the vendor does anything with those goods but YMF should not be forced to take those goods. The vendor could ship the leftover goods if YMF re-orders the exact same Styles as long as the Styles are kept in excellent condition and the vendor re-pack the Styles according to the new order if necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the shortage is more than 10% the first time the order is placed or if the shortage is more than 3% on the 2nd time the order is placed, YMF will give the vendor a penalty for loss of sales and increased container's cost due to shipping less than planned. The penalty will depend on the shortage amount.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Shipping Destinations
				</h3>
				<p>
					YMF ships to different destinations in the USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					To keep track of all the different destinations YMF ships to, the purchase order is set with a location code. The location codes are but not limited to: EC PORT, ECOM, FAIRWAY, LA PORT, MONROE, XINGANG and PR. If you were not given a location in the purchase order, contact your production coordinator(s) so they can provide it to you. These location codes must be used in our packing lists.
				</p>
				<h2 id="packing">
					PACKING & LABELING
				</h2>
				<h3>
					General Packing Requirements
				</h3>
				<p>
					Vendor must pack every Style exactly how it was specified in the purchase order. If we order an Style pack 12 per cartons and the carton were packed more or less this quantity without approval, there will be a penalty.
				</p>
				<p>
					YMF normally uses 2 kinds of packs. Either PPbags or Cartons.
				</p>
				<p>
					When using PPbags, vendors must make sure the PPbags are tight enough so goods do not move inside the PPbags, but loose enough so goods do not arrive wrinkled or creased.
				</p>
				<p>
					When using Cartons, vendors must use cartons that fits the Style to avoid crease. Ideally goods should be packed  0.25cm below the top of the carton. Do not over pack or under pack cartons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Styles in Purchase orders with Ecom location code must be packed individually inside a clear polybag before packing inside the PPbags or Cartons. On the clear polybag, vendor must print or place a label with the following warning: "WARNING: To avoid danger of suffocation, keep this plastic bag away from babies and children. Do not use this bag in cribs, beds, carriages or play pens. This bag is not a toy."
				</p>
				<h3>
					Packing Quality
				</h3>
				<p>
					PPbags must be at least 70gsm and must be weaved tight enough so that dust does not easily get inside the bags.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cartons must have the following specs: 130g per m2 inside and 160g outside A level Kraft paper, A/B strengthen paper which are 1 and 120g per m2 (powerful strengthen paper). And the core paper is 110g per m2. The paper board is at least between 660-800g/m2. Industry standard is a 200lb burst test:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Boxweights.jpg">
				</center>
				<h3>
					PPbag and Carton Sealing
				</h3>
				<p>
					All PPbags must be sealed using only sewing yarns. Do not use tape, staples or any other material to seal the PPbags.
				</p>
				<p>
					All Cartons must be sealed (top and bottom) with packing tape. All tape must be moisture/temperature resistant and have an adhesive quality that resists drying while in transit. Do not seal cartons with bands, staples, strings, straps or any sealant other than tape.
				</p>
				<h3>
					General Labeling Requirements
				</h3>
				<p>
					There are 4 types of PPbag or Carton labels that YMF normally uses. The labels vary depending on the purchase order. These are some examples of the labels:
				</p>
				<p>
					Purchase orders with Monroe or Fairway location code must use a 10cm x 10cm white label with the label code, PO#, Style#(Make the Font as big as possible), Description, Designs & Colors inside the ppbag or carton, All Sizes, Units quantity, carton barcode, Box # and Made in (Country of Origin). Example of Label Type A:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Boxlabel1.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					Please note the carton barcode type is (code 39) and it consists of the carton pack and the Style#. If the carton pack is one digit, you will add 0 in front of the number like you see in the above label. This Barcode cannot be printed on the boxes because our system won't be able to scan it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Purchase orders with Ecom location code must use a 10cm x 10cm orange label with the label code, PO#, Style#(Make the Font as big as possible), Description, Designs & Colors inside the ppbag or carton, All Sizes, Units quantity, carton barcode, Box # and Made in (Country of Origin). Example of Label Type B:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Boxlabel2.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					There are some purchase orders that must use a 10cmx10cm white label with the label code, YMF PO#, Customer PO#, SKU#, Style#, Description, Designs & Colors inside the ppbag or carton, All Sizes, Units quantity, Box# and Made in(Country of Origin). Example of Label Type C:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Boxlabel3.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					There are some purchase orders that must use 1 or 2 10cm x 15cm white label called ASN labels. If goods are packed with only one Style per pack, you will get one ASN label (the one on the left). If goods are packed assorted, you will get 2 ASN labels per pack. Example of Label Type D:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Boxlabel4.jpg">
				</center>
				<h3>
					PPbag Label Placement
				</h3>
				<p>
					When a purchase order requires PPbags, vendors must place one label on top center of the PPbag and one on the bottom center like in the picture below:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/PPbaglabel.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					When a purchase order is being shipped to Monroe or Fairway location code and requires ASN labels, vendors must place a type A and type D label on top and bottom of the PPbag.
				</p>
				<p>
					Labels must be visible and readable. If the labels have barcodes, the barcode cannot be covered with tape, cannot have wrinkles and cannot be smeared so that the barcode can be scanned.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vendors must use strong adhesive on labels that are being placed on PPbags to assure labels will not fall during loading the product in containers, in transit and unloading the product from the containers.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Carton Label Placement
				</h3>
				<p>
					When a purchase order requires cartons, vendor must place type A, B and C labels on the right sides of both width or shorter side of the box:
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/Boxlabelplacement.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					Vendors must email the production coordinator(s) JPEG of the labels before mass printing for final confirmation.
				</p>
				<p>
					When packing in cartons, ASN labels must be placed on the lower right-hand corner of the longest side of the carton. The bottom edge of the barcode should be located 1.25 inches from the bottom of the carton. The outer edge should be no closer than 1.25 inches and no greater than 3.0 inches to the edge of the vertical face. There should not be any tape, marking, or additional labels covering any part of the UPC on the ASN label.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img class="medium" src="images/ASNplacement.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>
					Each ASN label has a unique number which can be seen on the bottom of the barcode. Vendors must place each ASN label on a consecutive order in case there is a shortage. When the factory has a shortage and does not use all the ASN labels that YMF submitted, the factory must notify YMF which ASN label numbers were not used and the numbers must be the last numbers in consecutive order.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a purchase order that requires ASN labels needs more than one container, vendors must know and inform YMF which ASN label numbers were sent in container# 1 and which ASN label numbers were sent in container# 2.
				</p>
				<h2>
					SAMPLES PROCEDURES
				</h2>
				<p>
					When YMF orders a brand new Style from a vendor, the vendor must send to YMF's NY Showroom; lab dips of all colors ordered for approval within 3 business days from when the order is placed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all colorways have been approved, vendor must submit one finished pre-production sample of each colorway for production approval within 2 weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all pre-production samples are approved, vendor can proceed with production. Production must be the same quality or better than the approved pre-production sample.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once production is finished, vendors must send to YMF's NY Showroom one of each design and colorway ordered with complete packaging. If the purchase order has the same design and color in several sizes, the vendor can send different designs and colors in different sizes to avoid having to send too many samples.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vendors are responsible for the expense of shipping lab dips, pre-production samples and production samples to YMF.
				</p>
				<h2 id="inspections">
					INSPECTIONS PROCEDURES
				</h2>
				<p>
					Vendor is required to schedule 3 rounds inspections (When materials are first received at the factory, factory begin production and after 80% of goods are produced).
				</p>
				<p>
					Vendors must inform the production coordinator(s) the date production will start 1 week in advance to make arrangements with YMF's inspectors so that the inspectors can do an in-line inspection.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vendors must inform the inspectors what date 80% of the goods will be packaged so that inspectors can come back and do a final inspection. Final Inspection must be done at least 14 days before the loading date.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the inspection is done on the loading date or the day before the loading date, YMF will issue a penalty and/or it could result on the refusal of the goods.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vendors cannot ship containers before YMF receives and approves the final inspection report.
				</p>
